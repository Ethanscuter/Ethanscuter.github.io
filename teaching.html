  <h3>Teaching</h3>
  <blockquote><i>The subject of the lecture was beyond my competence. After the 
    first five minutes I was completely lost. At the end of the lecture an arcane 
    dialogue took place between the speaker and some members of the audience&mdash;Ambrose 
    and Singer if I remember correctly. There followed a period of tense silence. 
    Professor Struik broke the ice. He raised his hand and said, ``Give us something 
    to take home!'' Calabi obliged, and in the next five minutes he explained in 
    beautiful simple terms the gist of his lecture. Everybody filed out with a 
    feeling of satisfaction.</i><br/>&mdash;Gian-Carlo Rota</blockquote>
